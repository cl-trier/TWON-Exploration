I would give it a go. This is also my first Altman film so I didn't really know what to expect, except that people always compare PTA's Boogie Nights and Magnolia as being influenced by Altman. Magnolia is probably the best analog in terms of structure (having no lead character) but it is stylistically very different, much more melodramatic and transparently earnest.    \n",
