During the 2016 election, the Clinton crew retained the services of research firm Fusion GPS, who then hired Steele to gather information on this opposition research file. The same documents that were used to obtain a FISA warrant against former foreign policy adviser to Trump, Carter Page. Yeah, a partisan piece of opposition research from a political campaign was used to secure a warrant to spy on someone who had worked on the opposing campaign—all of this under the Obama DOJ mind you.

But as you carry on about how unethical and dishonest Trump\\'s ties with Russia might be; how can your argument be that the solution is/was to give a pass to proven unethical and dishonest behavior of his opponent? Your analysis that Trump is the problem is incorrect. He is a symptom. The problem is that America is tired of corporate establishment and corruption and that is the embodiment of Hillary. It was for that reason that a snake oil salesman baboon fuck like Trump was even given a chance in the first place. Did we learn nothing eight years ago when the electorate was so tired of \"politics as usual\" that they went out in droves voting for a black guy with a Muslim name that people questioned if he was born in Kenya with almost no political experience and lied through his teeth and we bought it with a catch phrase \"yes we can\" which apparently meant \"yes we can remove the public option\" and \"yes we can bail out Wall Street and kick 10 million people out of their homes\" and \"yes we can support Nafta and TPP\" and \"yes we can bomb the Middle East non stop and include more countries to bomb\" and \"yes we can extend the tax cut on dividends\" and \"yes we can keep the minimum wage low and create more minimum wage jobs with no benefits\" and \"yes we can make the banks even bigger\" and \"yes we can continue the income inequality and make the gap even larger\" and \"yes we can continue the drug war and continue to explode the prisons with disproportionately black non-violent offenders\".

Hillary didn\\'t lose because of racism. Or misogyny. Or Comey letters. Or Russia. She lost for one simple reason; because of Hillary.
