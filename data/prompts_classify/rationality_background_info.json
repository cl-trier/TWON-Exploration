Code YES when the comment tries to make an argument after having an understanding of the broader context.\nExample 1: 'So let me get this straight.

After getting called names like token minority and being called a stupid Asian' (personal anecdote). \\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0 or 1) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
