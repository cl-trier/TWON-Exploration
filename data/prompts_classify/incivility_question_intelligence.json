He was elected because of Russian interference, because of their smear campaign against Hillary, and because there is a segment of the American population who fell, and continue to fall…’\nExample 3 (code Yes (1)): ‘Most of Trump's supporters are living examples of what can happen when the reptile brain is overstimulated.’\nException 1: Saying somebody is wrong is not necessarily questioning another person’s intelligence should be code No (0) (e.g. ‘@Taekwon Yoo haha let me give u 10 articles that conclude with climate change being a fact proven by data.’)\nException 2: Saying that someone should not be taking up a position (e.g. president) without explaining that the person is incompetent or unintelligent should be coded as No (0) (e.g. ‘Whoever hacked exposed Hillary as a lying crooked corrupt bitch unqualified to be president’; ‘Haters of this country should not be running it!’)\\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0 or 1) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
