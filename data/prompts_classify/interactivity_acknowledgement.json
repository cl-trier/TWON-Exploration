    "template": "Does this comment acknowledge a previously posted user-comment or claim of another discussant? \nInstruction: By referring back to another comment, one recognizes the existence of a previous comment. Acknowledgment can be neutral or by explicitly endorsing another discussant's comment (e.g. 'I absolutely agree with what you're saying'). Keywords such as 'Yes; Yep; Exactly; I totally agree' may signal acknowledgement of a comment of another discussant. Acknowledgement can also be explicitly disagreeing with another discussant's comment or claim (e.g. '@RoniBox No, you're not right. Climate change is not real!'). \nA comment coded as YES for Acknowledgement is also likely to be coded as YES for Interaction. \nExample 1: '@tirtha simanta yeah but now someone deleted all of it' \nExample 2: 'Nope, that is not true' (is 1 under isReply) \nException 1: Code as NO if there is NOT a @username (or +1username, or username) NOR it is NOT a reply, because in most cases that means the comment is not referring to a commenter involved in the discussion. Whether this comment is a reply or not is indicated by 'isReply' ('1' means it is a reply) \nException 2: Code as NO if the comment is simply criticizing or cursing at another discussant (e.g. @Roompie Think properly, you fool), without explicitly saying that the writer (dis)agrees with another discussant. \\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0 or 1) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
