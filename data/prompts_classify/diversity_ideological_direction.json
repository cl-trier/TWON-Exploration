Also, consider the societal/political issue that the party/ideological wing usually supports or opposes. Democrats usually support feminism, LGBTQ+ community, environmental movement, diverse culture/race/religion (e.g. jew, muslim), inclusion of immigrants, legalization of week, gun regulation, and governmental intervention, while Republicans usually oppose them.\nMentioning a politically affiliated media company can also signal ideological direction. Comments against CNN, MSNBC, or New York Times are associated with the right wing, while those against Fox news are associated with the left wing (e.g. 'just gonna call bullshit. fake news again from CNN and this clown.' is Right/Conservative/Republican (3)). When the comment mentions politicians of a non-US country, you do not necessarily have to take into account their political wing.\nExample 1 (coded as Neutral (2)) : 'Wrong idiot... both parties' loyalty is with the Zionists Terrorists in Israel…'\nExample 2 (coded as Left/Liberal/Democratic (0)) : 'Conservatives have ALWAYS been on the wrong side of American Progress.'\nExample 3 (coded as Right/Conservative/Republican (3)) : 'Global warming is fake!'\nExample 4 (coded Unclear which direction (4)) : 'He's a traitor and a lying piece of s**t!!!'\nException: Comments that attack or support news media in general or without political relevance should be coded as Absent (1) (e.g. 'Syria responded US missiles attack with another chemical attack chlorine bombs at 11am and no news channel are on it!!').\\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0, 1, 2, 3 or 4) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
