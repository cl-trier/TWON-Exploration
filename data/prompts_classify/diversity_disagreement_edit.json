The disagreement should be apparent without needing interpretation. If unsure, code No (0).\nExamples:\nExplicit disagreement: ‘@Aubrey Calliope you're a fool, if those men wanted to take down the US government they would've.’\nSimple negation: ‘No, that is simply not true’\nSarcastic/implicit disagreement: @Taekwon Yoo HAHA, let me give u 10 articles that conclude with climate change being a fact proven by data.’ \nException: If the comment could be a response rather than a disagreement (e.g., answering a question or clarifying information), code No (0). Example: ‘@Michael T there was never a remake. That movie never happened. Nope, did not happen.’\\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0 or 1) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
