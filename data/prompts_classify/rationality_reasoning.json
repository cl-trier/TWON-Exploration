    "template": "Does this comment try to justify its comment with explicit reasoning or argumentation?\nInstruction: Code YES when the comment explicitly elaborates on the opinion that was put forward, by using any kind of reasoning. The use of words such as 'because', 'due to', 'therefore' can signal the attempt of justification, but comments without them may still be coded as YES in case the comment follows a clear line of arguments. The argument can come before the reasoning/justification (e.g. Trump is pure evil, he pushes for nuclear war), or after the reasoning/justification (e.g. our out of control obesity epidemic would make this event impossible in the states).\nExample 1: 'Fox News watchers evidently, right? Because all the rest of us know trump has lied more than, probably, any other American citizen, EVER!' (explicit reasoning with 'because')\nExample 2: 'Dems policies will destroy the economy and society...keep them out/shutdown!' (implicit reasoning without 'because')\\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0 or 1) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
