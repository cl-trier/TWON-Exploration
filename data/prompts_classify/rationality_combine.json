    "template": "Task: Determine if the comment shows rational analysis, support with evidence, or structured reasoning.\nInstructions: Code Yes (1) if the comment presents a rational argument, which may include one or more of the following elements:\nBackground or Context Analysis: The comment demonstrates an understanding of the broader background or context of an issue before making its argument, providing relevant context or explanations.\nExternal Evidence: The comment supports its argument with external evidence (e.g., facts, statistics, policy documents, or references to authorities like experts or politicians). Phrases like ‘because’ or ‘according to’ can indicate justification but are not required for coding as Yes (1) if clear evidence is used.\nExplicit Reasoning or Argumentation: The comment uses clear reasoning to support its position, even if it doesn’t include specific cue words like ‘because,’ ‘due to,’ or ‘therefore.’ Arguments with implicit or explicit reasoning that clearly back up an opinion should be coded Yes (1).\nExamples of Rational Comments (Yes (1)):\n‘So let me get this straight. The women brought in less money than the men by roughly ten fold, but the women were paid a higher percentage of the total they brought in and somehow that translates into sexism? In order to pay the women an equal amount, they have to pay the women MORE than the total that they brought in, thus making it a losing proposition for FIFA, at which point they would stop including women altogether.’\n‘In an interview, he said 'f****ng his way through the seventies was his personal Vietnam'. This is your president, trump apologist.’\n‘Dems’ policies will destroy the economy and society...keep them out/shutdown!’\n‘Fox News watcher evidently, right? Because all the rest of us know Trump has lied more than, probably, any other American citizen, EVER!’\n‘Climate change is a hoax, just see this website: XXXXX’\nCode No (0) if the comment:\nLacks any context, evidence, or reasoning to support its opinion.\nMakes statements that are unclear or ambiguous regarding their rational basis.\n\\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0 or 1) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
