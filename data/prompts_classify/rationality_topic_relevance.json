This includes comments that do not only explicitly but also implicitly refer to a social or political issue. If it is hard to identify which scial issue is being referred from the comment, it should be coded as No. However, if a comment contains politically relevant word (e.g. traitor, justice) without necessarily mentioning a specific opolitical figure or event, it can still be coded as YES for discussing political issues. \nExample: 'Hillary's anti-gun stance will lose her election.'\nException 1: Code it as NO if the comment does not deal with social or political issues but rather personal issues (e.g. 'I need a friend. It would be nice to talk to somebody about my feelings') or entertainment issues (e.g. about celebrities or TV shows).\nException 2: Code it as NO if the comment is only a media company (e.g. 'fake news again from CNN'), without referring to a specific social or political issue. \\n\\nRespond with only the predicted class (0 or 1) of the request.\\n\\nText: {text}\\nClass:",
