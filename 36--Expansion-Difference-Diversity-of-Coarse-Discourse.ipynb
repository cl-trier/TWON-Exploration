The Texas cop even says that he can arrest you for any offense other than speeding or open carry. Another says he will delay you until he gets a K9 unit (which we know often falsely alerts). \\n\\nCheck out the responses. Pretty shocking.', 'this is disgusting to see these people who are supposed to help protect us discuss ways to hurt someone who is simply acting within their rights.', '\"Refusing to roll you window down more than two inches in and of itself is suspicious. It suggests the odor of something is present inside your car that you do not want the officer to smell, such as drugs or alcohol. It also suggests you may be using the angle of the glass and any reflections off it to obscure contraband in the car you don\\'t want the officer to see. It can also obscure the placement of your hands if you are reaching for a weapon. Finally, only rolling down the window by two inches may make it difficult for the officer to hear what you are saying over adjacent traffic and road noise.\\n\\nFor reasons of officer safety and/or completion of the citation, it might result in your being directed to exit the car. If the officer knew how to articulate it properly, a charge of delaying/obstructing could result if you refused to comply. \"\\n\\nGuilty until proven Innocent. Gross. ', \"And they somehow have the gall to whine about how the public doesn't trust them. \", '\"any attitude increases the chance of a citation.\" isnt it important to evenly enforce the law? Or do we not really care about the law that much. ', \">The Texas cop even says that he can arrest you for any offense other than speeding or open carry.\\n\\nHe said open *container*. Open carry of a handgun is illegal in Texas as well, but I don't know if they'd ticket you or arrest you for it.\", 'Both. But it also makes it more difficult for the cop to claim that he smells something in your car that would give him RAS to search it and/or give you a sobriety test.', 'Opening the window all the way is giving the cop an avenue to poke his head in your car and manufacture probable cause by claiming to smell drugs.', \"If I've committed a crime or broken some traffic law I'm going to roll down my window and attempt to be polite in the hopes it will lessen the ticketing. If I've done nothing wrong I'm going to lower it just a small amount mainly to fusck with the cop and send a message that I'm not going to submit to control if I can avoid it. Also possibly get some good Youtube video FTW.\", 'I\\'ve got a camera watching my spedometer while I drive (paranoid? sure why not, but it gets me cleared in court!) I posted my interaction with cops before:\\n\\nOfficer- \"Do you know how fast you were going?\"\\n\\nMe- \"Yes sir, I do.\"\\n\\nOfficer- \"................ well?\"\\n\\nMe- \"Well, if you don\\'t know, why\\'d you pull me over? Am I free to go then?\"\\n\\nThe response from the officer varies, I got off with a warning only one time cause it made the cop laugh. Other times, it just pisses off the cop more, and then pissed them off even more when I submit the video evidence in court in my defense. Extreme to fight a $50-150 ticket? Maybe, but that\\'s a tax I shouldn\\'t have to pay since I did nothing wrong and I have the evidence to prove it.\\n\\nOne time I suggested to the Judge that since it\\'s clear that his RADAR gun was not functioning properly that day (since I got clocked at 65 in a 55 but my video shows me no more than 57) that all the speeding tickets he issued that day should be thrown out since he doesn\\'t have documentation of recalibrating or repairing his device between my ticket and subsequent tickets after mine. The Judge didn\\'t like that and suggested I leave with my not guilty verdict as soon as possible.\\n\\nLiberty and Justice my ass.\\n\\n', \"You were found not guilty with proof that you were going over the limit? Was that the judge being a reasonable guy or is there a law that says you're allowed to go over within a certain amount?\", 'This is a great question. I wondered myself, and I think both of your assumptions are probably true! I don\\'t know that a cop would reach in, but it does interfere with him/her being able to find suspicion without having it at the time of the stop. \\n\\nI found this interesting in that cop forum:\\n\\n\"You know you can legally make them get out of the car, right?\"\\n\\nThe case being referred to is quoted in the forum as *Pennsylvania v. Mimms* (for the driver). You can read the wiki article, but the case surrounds the back and forth reversal of a guy convicted of unlawful carry. The cop saw the bulge, got concerned for their personal safety, and ordered him out of the car for a pat down. The PSC says this wasn\\'t unlawful because the cop saw the bulge and he\\'s legally entitled to reasonable suspicion and protection of officer safety. \\n\\nThis is important to your question since, assuming the cop is pulling you over a basic traffic stop, there is no reason for him to assume there is anything you are guilty of *inside the car*. He\\'s only witnessed and has reasonable suspicion of your behavior on the road (speeding, rolling stop, whatever). In the case of PvM, had the cop not been able to see inside the car, the question of the bulge would have been moot.', '>  The cop saw the bulge, got concerned for their personal safety, and ordered him out of the car for a pat down.\\n\\nI do not believe that this is correct. Wikipedia states: \"The cop told Mimms to exit the vehicle, and when Mimms stepped out the police officer noticed a bulge in his pants under his jacket, and conducted a pat-down, finding a weapon. \"\\n\\nThe question was then whether or not the cop was allowed to order him out of the car in the first place. The SCOTUS ruled that the additional minor inconvenience of having to exit the vehicle was justified by the safety of the officer. \\n', \"What I want to know is why we think taking sex into consideration is fine for health/auto insurance, while race is not.\\n\\nAccording to [this](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-09-18/news/0909170110_1_health-disparities-eliminating-health-reforming-health/2) article.\\n\\n* Mexican-Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as whites.\\n\\n* Vietnamese-American women have nearly five times the rate of cervical cancer as white women.\\n\\n* Black men are twice as likely to have prostate cancer as white men.\\n\\nAt least in the U.K., certain ethnic minority groups are more likely to get injured than other ethnic minority groups in car accidents. [Link](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/road-safety-of-londons-black-asian-minority-ethnic-groups.pdf). I'm guessing this means they get into more car accidents (although I couldn't find any study that measured accidents by race/ethnicity). Does this mean we should take race into consideration when forming auto insurance policies?\\n\\n\\nWhy is it acceptable to draw lines between males and females, but not for everybody else?\\n\", 'Age does seem fairer than sex or race, since \"everyone\" goes through all the ages (or dies, at which point they\\'re not going to care about insurance premiums). That means that, for car insurance, a flat rate act as a wealth transfer from the old to the young, but in effect the young would be borrowing the money.\\n\\nOTOH, age-invariant insurance bills for car insurance would probably work out in my favour, since I\\'m young now and the birth rate is falling. However, I think that would be cancelled out by age-invariant health insurance, at least in the next few years.', \"While I agree that health insurance is no way to do healthcare (socialized healthcare needs to happen). I have to disagree with you. Why do you think men should pay higher auto rates? Because they are more likely to need the insurance. Why should women pay higher health insurance rates? Because generally speaking, they're going to use it more. Yeah, not every woman is going to need to use their health insurance, but not every guy is going to drive like a dumbass :)\\n\\nAlso, ponies are stupid *tease*\", \"Pretty much exactly this. Well, maybe. I don't think either should discriminate based on sex, but I do think that they are the same situation, and that we should be consistent. Either no sex discrimination in insurance or we do allow sex discrimination in insurance. \", \"Would women end up paying more health insurance if they judged it by sex? I'm from the UK so I don't really know how it works. \", \"Yes., women pay more for health insurance. Young men pay more for auto insurance (for older men it evens out).\\n\\nThing is, I'm thinking the most important part is the apples v. oranges, or how much the two insurances are apples and oranges. Auto insurance is for Shitthathappens. Health insurance is treated as being for preventive care as well as Shitthathappens.\\n\\nI'm beginning to think this is way less a feminist issue and more a political issue.\", \"When you're talking about gender, I think both always manage to slip in somehow!\\n\\nIt's a hard one for me because I oppose the idea of private healthcare so deeply. I think there is a difference between charging someone a premium based on something wholly outside their control, and something which they have a power to change. If women need further access to healthcare because they are women, because they need the pill or whatever it is, it seems discriminatory in a way car insurance doesn't. Sure, you are profiling people based on their demographic, but this is a situation they can change by not getting into car accidents and lowering their premium by being a good driver. So the profiling is more about outweighing the risks for the insurance company when you're a new driver, or an unknown. \\n\\nAlso, healthcare is a basic necessity, and while I know that for some people driving is incredibly important, it's not a universal need like healthcare is. I think my gut reaction is oppose anything that makes access to healthcare more difficult for anyone.\", \"I think my gut reaction is oppose anything that makes access to healthcare more difficult for anyone.\\n\\nBut it's not like women's premiums will just go down though. Men's premiums will go up too and presumably meet somewhere in the middle. If we judge access to healthcare based on price, you're making it more difficult for men to have access to healthcare.\", 'I disagree with private healthcare, full stop.', 'Socialized medicine is not without its problems as well. ', \">I'm beginning to think this is way less a feminist issue and more a political issue.\\n\\nI think you may be right.\\n\\nConsider that in the EU, auto insurance has become equal. This was possible because the political climate there is far different than USA. \", \"Auto insurance should start the same for both genders. Obviously, if you drive a Yellow sports car and have gotten in several accidents, you should pay more. However, assuming that ALL men drive crazier (and therefore making them pay more) is just sexist, and these companies are making money off of it.\\n\\nAs for health insurance, I can't say too much ether way about it, since I don't know too much (military child. Still have tricare for a couple years, so I don't have to worry about prices). I'm gonna say that everyone should pay the same, though.\", \"Congrats! You've been downvoted in a feminist forum for saying that the ability to drive a car safely doesn't depend on your genitals and that women shouldn't have to pay more for health insurance. Reddit would be so much better if you actually had to reply to a post to downvote it.\", 'Europe recently has made it so that sex is not a factor for insurance coverage.\\n\\nThe insurance rate increases due to sex as a factor stems from one sex costing more to service.\\n\\nMost health insurances cover things like general check-ups. Women use these services a lot more and they also have greater specialised care in the form of OB/GYN. This means that women, as a group, cost more to insure.\\n\\nAuto insurance is a little bit different. While men have more accidents than women - men also drive a lot more than women. Women actually have a higher rate of accidents/mile. However, because of the way actuary tables are done - it only takes in the \"men have more accidents\" part of the statistic.(I\\'m not saying that men are better drivers than women - driving ability has nothing to do with a person\\'s sex).\\n\\nBoth of these factors however reflect on the sex - not the person. This is generalizing the person and labeling them based on certain traits.', \"Yeah, ultimately I think it's uncool to charge young men more for insurance than young women. I do think it's different from health insurance, though, for several reasons:\\n\\n1) The reason women are in some places charged more for health insurance than men is because pregnancy, abortion, and childbirth are all expensive. But guess what? In all of those cases, there are actually two people responsible for the pregnancy and whose services are being covered. Women shouldn't be penalized because they are the ones with the bodies that carry the baby. Auto accidents are not caused by biology, but by different ways men and women drive, which is related to socialization. One is changeable, the other is not.\\n\\n2) The less trivial something is, the more indignant about sexism I get. Health insurance is so basic, so closely related to a human right (the right to life and well-being) that it's more disgusting to see its accessibility limited by the person's biology than things that aren't. I'm a government-for-necessities, market-for-luxuries kind of person. Socialized medicine FTW!\", \">Auto accidents are not caused by biology, but by different ways men and women drive, which is related to socialization.\\n\\nI'm confuse about this statement. Are you are saying that women and men drive differently because of society?\\n\\nEDIT:English is not my first language. Sorry if I misunderstood what you just say.\", 'I understand the ever hate for sexism, but is all sexism really bad?', \"Presumably he means non-malicious discrimination, as occurs from things like actuarial tables, or as a result of market forces (overpriced women's clothes).\\n\\nI think the answer to that depends more on your economic views than your gender-equality views.\"]\n"

It can also obscure the placement of your hands if you are reaching for a weapon. Finally, only rolling down the window by two inches may make it difficult for the officer to hear what you are saying over adjacent traffic and road noise.\\\\n\\\\nFor reasons of officer safety and/or completion of the citation, it might result in your being directed to exit the car.

The concept is/was one that was long held as a  [Core American Value](http://talkingsociology.blogspot.com/2008/05/core-american-values-handout.html?m=1). From a young age we're taught that we need to always work hard in order to live a good life; however, this leads a lot of people to feel the way you feel: if you're not busy then you're floundering. You need to find hobbies that you enjoy simply for the benefit of you enjoying them. There's nothing wrong with spending your time doing something you might consider frivolous. It's your life - enjoy the free time you have.\\n\\nEdit: Added blog post for anyone interested.\",\n",
       " \"The concept of success being tied to constant productivity is deeply ingrained in American culture, which can lead people to feel like they're floundering if they're not busy. This mindset is partly a result of capitalism's emphasis on high-paying jobs and wealth as measures of success. However, this perspective is not unique to the US, as it's also prevalent among the Middle Class in other countries.\",\n",
       " \"It's ironic that it's often those with the least free time who don't know what to do with it, whereas some Americans struggle with having too much free time after their kids move out or they retire. Meanwhile, people like me are busy with other activities beyond work and need to fill up our time. I'm curious to know how Europeans who tend towards renting and smaller houses manage their time, as it seems like there aren't the same opportunities for DIY projects and hobbies that I have in my own home.\",\n",
       " 'In many European countries, people have more free time due to a shorter standard working week (often 5x8h) and higher home ownership rates. They use this extra time for hobbies like sports, music, or volunteering, often investing more time in these activities than Americans do. For example, team sports are very popular, with many people participating in organized competitions on weekends. Additionally, Europeans often have clubs and societies for various interests, providing opportunities to meet new people and engage in activities outside of work.',\n",
       " \"The US government has really tried to promote home ownership (that's a major criticism that a lot of people, including me, have), but, like you said, it's still lower than the EU average. It's also somewhat counterintuitive for me because the US is a less urban country, and I think of people in rural and suburban areas being more likely to own homes, mainly because housing as a % of income tends to be much lower in those places.\",\n",
       " \"The standard working week is 5 days with 8 hours each day, which allows for a significant amount of free time. Home ownership rates are actually lower in Europe than the US average, and they vary greatly between countries. In many European cities, allotments (small plots of land for gardening) are quite popular among residents. Some people also engage in local politics or sports, such as biking, while others may have more personalized interests that don't necessarily fit into these categories.\",\n",
       " \"Most EU countries have higher home ownership rates than the US. However, that doesn't mean people in Europe don't have time for DIY projects - it's actually very popular here. The extra free time is often spent on hobbies, with people investing more time into them compared to Americans. For example, sports like soccer, volleyball, and basketball are enjoyed by many, but instead of just playing pick-up games or a beer league, Europeans typically participate in organized competitions that require regular training sessions and matches. This trend can be seen in other activities as well, such as chess, which has a wide range of tournaments and competitions available for those who are passionate about it. Additionally, volunteering opportunities abound to support these hobbies and clubs, making it easy for people to find ways to spend their free time productively.\",\n",
       " \"In the US, you're usually not allowed to alter your rented home because most people don't want to improve someone else's property and/or they're afraid of being sued by their landlord. I think the original poster is extrapolating some ideas from the US mentality to European mentality that aren't necessarily true.\",\n",
       " 'In Denmark, people work 33 hours a week on average, which allows them to have more free time and engage in various activities. This is reflected in the Danish saying \"When two Danes meet, they shake hands. When three Danes meet they create a club,\" highlighting their tendency to form clubs and societies for different interests. Many towns in Denmark have sports associations, scout movements, allotments, and other community groups that people can join.

The target claim is: <<[\"Cops are discussing retaliating against drivers who exercise their rights during traffic stops\"]>>.\\n2. The preceding claims and indices are: <[{\"claim_index\":0,\"claims\":\"[\\\"The police car has a partition to prevent the officer from reaching in\\\"]}>]>. There is only one preceding claim.\\n\\nSince there is only one preceding claim, I will consider it as the most similar claim by default (step 2).\\n\\n3. The claim_index of this most similar claim is: 0 (step 3).\\n\\n4. To determine the degree of similarity between the target claim and the most similar claim, I will analyze their content:\\n\\nTarget claim: \"Cops are discussing retaliating against drivers who exercise their rights during traffic stops\"\\nMost similar claim: \"The police car has a partition to prevent the officer from reaching in\"\\n\\nAlthough the claims seem unrelated at first glance, they both relate to interactions between law enforcement and citizens. The most similar aspect is that they both involve some form of restriction or limitation on the actions of law enforcement officers (the partition preventing physical contact, and the discussion of retaliating against drivers exercising their rights).\\n\\nHowever, considering the significant difference in content and context, I would rate the similarity score as 2 out of 10.\\n\\n5. Since we have determined a similarity score, our response will be:\\n\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"most_similar_claim_index\": \"0\",\\n        \"similarity_score\": \"2\"\\n    }\\n]\n",
      "2  To determine the degree of similarity between the target claim and the preceding claims, I will follow the steps outlined:\\n\\n**Step 1: Identify the target claim**\\nTarget claim: << \"A Texas cop claims he can arrest for any offense other than speeding or open carry\">>\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine the most similar claim in the preceding claims**\\n\\nThe preceding claims are:\\n<[{\"claim_index\":0,\"claims\":\"[\\\"The police car has a partition to prevent the officer from reaching in\"},{\"claim_index\":1,\"claims\":\" \\\"The partition is to indicate lack of consent for searches\\\"]\"}]>\\n\\nComparing the target claim with each preceding claim, I notice that none of them are identical or very similar. However, I can see some connection between the concepts of \"arrest\" and \"searches\". The most similar claim seems to be related to searches, which is present in both claims.\\n\\n**Step 3: Find the claim_index of this most similar claim**\\n\\nThe most similar claim is related to searches, which is present in claim_index 1.\\n\\n**Step 4: Identify the degree of similarity on a range of 1-10**\\n\\nConsidering the target claim and the most similar claim (claim_index 1), I would rate their similarity as follows:\\n\\n* The concept of \"arrest\" is not explicitly mentioned in claim_index 1, but it's related to searches.\\n* The context of the claims is different (police car vs. Texas cop).\\n* However, there is a connection between the two concepts.\\n\\nBased on these observations, I would rate their similarity as 4 out of 10.\\n\\n**Step 5: Combine the results**\\n\\nSince we have determined the most similar claim and its degree of similarity, we can combine them into a single response:\\n\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"most_similar_claim_index\": \"1\",\\n        \"similarity_score\": \"4\"\\n    }\\n]\\n\\nThis response indicates that the most similar claim is at index 1 with a similarity score of 4.\n"
